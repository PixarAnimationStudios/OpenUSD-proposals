## Structure

Create new proposals here, in their own directories.

A Readme.md file should exist in each directory, and may contain 
the entire proposal, or it may serve as an index to the rest of the materials
within the proposal.

## All Proposals and PRs

See the [OpenUSD Proposals Status](https://github.com/orgs/PixarAnimationStudios/projects/1/views/1) project page for a list of all proposals, proposal PRs, and status.
