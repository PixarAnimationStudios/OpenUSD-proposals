## TL;DR
We propose adding attributes to UsdShade `Material` primitives to record the MaterialX library version they were authored
with. This will allow for MaterialX to provide an automatic upgrade functionality to the data stored in OpenUSD.

The following is an example of a `Material` primitive with the applied schema applied.
```
def "Material" MyMaterial ( 
    prepend apiSchemas = ["MaterialXInfoAPI"]
)
{
    uniform string mtlxinfo:version = "1.39"
}
```

## Introduction
From its inception, the MaterialX project has considered MaterialX documents to be an archival format.  What goes along 
with this is an implied promise that opening a MaterialX file from 10+ years ago should generate a material that will 
render a qualitatively similar image.  This promise is honored by the project in the form of an automatic system that 
upgrades data as documents are loaded to be compatible with the current MaterialX library.

The MaterialX library is a collection of XML files that describe a standard set of node definitions, type definitions and 
other components provided by MaterialX.  The Material library version is a `major.minor` version number (currently 1.38) 
and allows that set of definitions to be versioned.  It is not the version of the MaterialX project itself, which also 
includes a `patch` version number, but the MaterialX library version does track in-sync with the MaterialX project version.

The MaterialX integration within OpenUSD relies upon two libraries, `UsdMtlx` and `HdMtlx`. `UsdMtlx` transcodes the 
MaterialX document in to `UsdShade` primitives. Inside of Hydra, `HdMtlx` is used to reconstruct the
MaterialX document using the `UsdShade` primitives that have been transported through Hydra (more information 
available [here](https://openusd.org/release/api/_page__material_x__in__hydra__u_s_d.html)). The reconstructed MaterialX 
document is then passed to the MaterialX Shader Generation library to generate shader code in the desired destination
shading languages.

## Problem
For the entire lifetime of MaterialX support within OpenUSD, there has never been a MaterialX library version change. The 
MaterialX library version has always been v1.38. The MaterialX project would like to be able to update the MaterialX 
library version without invalidating MaterialX data currently stored in OpenUSD files. Without access to the MaterialX 
library version the upgrade code path inside the MaterialX project cannot be used.

Without some sort of remedy, either MaterialX will be constrained to stay at version 1.38, or OpenUSD will become a 
container for ambiguous MaterialX data.  

## Proposal to Version MaterialX data in OpenUSD
### Overview
We propose adding an applied API schema `MaterialXInfoAPI` (in the spirit of the 
["Revise use of Layer Metadata in USD"](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD-proposals/blob/main/proposals/revise_use_of_layer_metadata/README.md)) that can record the MaterialX library version. We keep the name of the 
applied API schema a little more generalized to leave the door open for additional MaterialX document information to be
added to the schema at a later date. We deliberately decide to only propose adding the MaterialX library version to the 
schema to keep the proposal as uncontroversial as possible to add rapid adoption.

The `MaterialXInfoAPI` will be applied to the UsdShade `Material` primitive. This allows for referencing the material 
directly from a `.mtlx` file and still retaining the MaterialX library version when the scene is composed. i.e.
```
def "Material" MyMaterial (
    references=@myMaterials.mtlx@</MaterialX/Materials/MyMaterial>
)
{}
```

Any UsdShade `Material` primitives that do not have the applied API would be assumed to be version 1.38, thus providing a 
path forward to support existing OpenUSD files that are not using this applied API schema.

With the MaterialX library version recorded in the OpenUSD stage, `HdMtlx` would now have access to an appropriate 
version number to use when re-constructing the MaterialX document. This will then allow the existing MaterialX upgrade 
functionality to be used.

### UsdMtlx Implementation changes

The only change required in `UsdMtlx` would be to apply the applied API schema to the `Material` primitive, and set the
MaterialX library version.  This version number would come directly from the `.mtlx` file that was being transcoded to 
OpenUSD.

### HdMtlx Implementation changes.

The `HdMtlx` library will also need to be changed to read the MaterialX library version from the `Material` primitive, 
and author this version number in the reconstructed MaterialX document.

If the version is not present it will be assumed to be v1.38. 

## Out of Scope
We do not propose any sort of validation regarding the version other than its presence, and then falling back
to the default if missing. 

Specifically we do not propose attempting to validate that all opinions that make up a composed
`Material` primitive were authored with the same MaterialX version, even though this composition could lead to an
invalid MaterialX material, for a number of reasons.
* The expense of the validation, in some circumstances, could be too high to consider.
* It is possible that a `Material` primitive may still contain a valid MaterialX material even if composed of differing
  MaterialX library versions.
* Reporting the error during the evaluation of Hydra may be later in a pipeline than desired.
* Some implementations might not even use the `HdMtlx` library to extract the MaterialX material.

Instead, we propose to leverage another OpenUSD proposal, the [USD Validation Framework](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD-proposals/tree/main/proposals/usd-validation-framework). Adding a `UsdValidator` to
inspect all layers that contribute opinions to a UsdShade `Material` primitive, and reporting an error if opinions are
found that were authored with conflicting MaterialX library versions.

This proposal also does not attempt to update in-place any OpenUSD data, or provide functionality to do so. The complex 
nature of scene composition makes this a difficult problem to tackle, and while this problem could possibly be tackled 
in the future, we think it prudent to keep the scope of this problem tractable to expedite forward progress.

We are only proposing to add version information to OpenUSD regarding the MaterialX library, to facilitate using the upgrade
mechanisms in MaterialX that already exist. This places the responsibility of the actual upgrade on the MaterialX project.
MaterialX currently does not provide any promise of forward compatibility. This proposal does not seek to add this, or 
any sort of new compatibility or upgrade functionality to MaterialX.

## Other solutions considered

Initial conversations around this topic started with discussions of adding layer metadata to the layers containing 
MaterialX information, but in light of the recent proposal to move away from layer metadata the direction of the 
conversation was changed.

We also considered authoring the MaterialX library version on each UsdShade `Shader` primitive, in the hope that it 
would allow more concrete support, or at least discovery, of mismatched MaterialX library versions created during USD 
composition.  This idea was discarded on the grounds that it would be both noisy in the USD data, and also potentially 
error prone if being authored by hand. A single applied API schema for the entire `Material` primitive seemed like a 
better compromise.
