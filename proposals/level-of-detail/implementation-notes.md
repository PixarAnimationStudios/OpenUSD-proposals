# Implementation Considerations for LOD Schema

## Runtime Selection Algorithm

The LOD selection algorithm should consider:

1. **Performance**: The algorithm should be efficient to avoid becoming a bottleneck
2. **Stability**: Avoid frequent switching between LOD levels that could cause visual popping
3. **Hysteresis**: Consider implementing a hysteresis buffer to prevent oscillation between levels
4. **View Frustum**: Only perform LOD calculations for objects within the view frustum
5. **Importance**: Allow for importance factors that can bias LOD selection for critical objects

## Integration with Hydra

The LOD schema should integrate with Hydra rendering:

1. **Render Delegates**: Render delegates should respect the LOD selection
2. **Task Controllers**: Task controllers may need to be extended to handle LOD selection
3. **Scene Indices**: Scene indices could be used to filter and select appropriate LOD levels
4. **Render Buffers**: Consider specialized buffers for cross-fade transitions

## Authoring Workflows

Considerations for content creation:

1. **Automatic Generation**: Tools for automatically generating lower LOD levels from high-detail models
2. **Validation**: Validation tools to ensure LOD levels meet quality and performance requirements
3. **Preview**: Preview tools to visualize LOD transitions and selection thresholds
4. **Metrics**: Tools for measuring and optimizing LOD performance

## Compatibility with Existing Features

The LOD schema should work well with:

1. **Variants**: Consider how LOD might leverage or complement USD variants
2. **References**: Support for referencing external assets for different LOD levels
3. **Payloads**: Integration with payload loading for streaming LOD levels
4. **Instancing**: Efficient handling of instanced geometry across LOD levels
5. **Point Instancer**: Special considerations for point instancer LOD

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memory Management**: Strategies for efficiently loading/unloading LOD levels
2. **GPU Resources**: Managing GPU memory for multiple LOD representations
3. **Streaming**: Progressive loading of LOD levels in streaming scenarios
4. **Batching**: Efficient batching of similar LOD levels for rendering
