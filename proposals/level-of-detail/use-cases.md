# LOD Schema Use Cases

## Large-Scale Environments

**Scenario**: City visualization with thousands of buildings  
**Benefits**:
- Distant buildings can use simplified geometry
- Only buildings close to the camera need high detail
- Significant performance improvements for large scenes

**Example**:
```
def "CityBlock" (
    kind = "assembly"
)
{
    def LodGroup "BuildingLOD" (
        lodMetric = "distance"
        lodRanges = [50.0, 200.0, 500.0]
    )
    {
        rel lodTargets = [
            </CityBlock/BuildingLOD/HighDetail>,
            </CityBlock/BuildingLOD/MediumDetail>,
            </CityBlock/BuildingLOD/LowDetail>,
            </CityBlock/BuildingLOD/VeryLowDetail>
        ]
        
        # LOD levels defined here...
    }
}
```

## Mobile/Web Applications

**Scenario**: 3D content for resource-constrained devices  
**Benefits**:
- Adapt detail level based on device capabilities
- Optimize for battery life and performance
- Support progressive loading for bandwidth-limited scenarios

**Example**:
```
def "MobileAsset" (
    kind = "component"
)
{
    def LodGroup "AssetLOD" (
        lodMetric = "pixelCount"  # Based on screen coverage
        lodRanges = [5000, 1000, 100]
    )
    {
        # LOD levels defined here...
    }
}
```

## Character Animation

**Scenario**: Characters with complex geometry and rigging  
**Benefits**:
- Maintain high detail for close-up shots
- Reduce complexity for background characters
- Optimize animation performance for crowd scenes

**Example**:
```
def "Character" (
    kind = "component"
)
{
    def LodGroup "CharacterLOD" (
        lodMetric = "distance"
        lodRanges = [5.0, 20.0, 50.0]
        fadeTransitions = true
    )
    {
        # LOD levels with different mesh and rig complexity
    }
}
```

## VR/AR Applications

**Scenario**: Immersive experiences with performance constraints  
**Benefits**:
- Maintain high frame rates required for comfort
- Focus detail on objects in the user's field of view
- Adapt to different VR/AR hardware capabilities

**Example**:
```
def "VRScene" (
    kind = "assembly"
)
{
    def LodGroup "ObjectLOD" (
        lodMetric = "custom"  # Custom metric for VR importance
        customMetricPlugin = "vr.importance.plugin"
        lodRanges = [0.8, 0.5, 0.2]
    )
    {
        # LOD levels defined here...
    }
}
```

## Streaming Media Production

**Scenario**: Real-time visualization for virtual production  
**Benefits**:
- Optimize scene for camera position and field of view
- Maintain visual quality for in-camera elements
- Reduce detail for off-camera elements

**Example**:
```
def "VirtualSet" (
    kind = "assembly"
)
{
    def LodGroup "SetLOD" (
        lodMetric = "screenSize"
        lodRanges = [0.5, 0.2, 0.05]  # Portion of screen covered
    )
    {
        # LOD levels defined here...
    }
}
```

## CAD/Engineering Visualization

**Scenario**: Complex mechanical assemblies with thousands of parts  
**Benefits**:
- Maintain precision for engineering analysis
- Simplify distant or less important components
- Support interactive exploration of large assemblies

**Example**:
```
def "MechanicalAssembly" (
    kind = "assembly"
)
{
    def LodGroup "ComponentLOD" (
        lodMetric = "distance"
        lodRanges = [1.0, 5.0, 20.0]
    )
    {
        # LOD levels with varying detail for engineering components
    }
}
```
